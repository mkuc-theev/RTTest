# RTTest

A CPU-based rendering of a sphere using simple mathematical steps dependent on the pixel's coordinate. The steps are taken from the Human Shader project.

You can play around with different resolutions, though the zoom and squish ratio are gonna be different for different resolutions, so you'll have to divine those yourself (I'm too lazy to come up with a reliable calculation for them)

This was quickly put together after computing a few pixels by hand for the project, to see what a full-res image would look like. It's not optimized, or even good code. It's simply designed to follow the algorithm from the worksheet.

If you want to run this code yourself, you'll need to set up SFML.
